            <h1 class="who"> Who Am I? </h1>

            <p class="who__text">Previously i would describe myself as a common grey person. Work, school, sleep, repeat. At the beginning I got into IT industry with a bunch of hardware and operating systems knowledge. I thought my destiny was to work as an IT Specialist. Everything changed when i started exploring programming world and accidentally fell into a giant ocean of possibilities which coding creates. I was getting more and more curious everyday and eventually fell in love with programming especially in Web Development. My goal is to improve my skills everyday and finally become a Front End Developer.</p>
